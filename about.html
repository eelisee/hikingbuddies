                Hi! We are a group of four students who love hiking. We created HIKING BUDDIES as a project for a class
                about web development. We learned how to create and design websites in quite a short amount of time and
                with a little creativity and our new knowledge we built this website for people who enjoy hiking as well.
                Our goal is to bring people with the same hobby together and maybe even create friendships.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                If you hike regularly but haven't found a buddy yet, this is the place for you! You can either join a
                hike from someone else or create your own. We are happy to welcome you as a part of the HIKING BUDDIES
                community!
            </p>
